Here are some notes on deployment of ZooKeeper with the associated CloudFormation template in this directory.

Since zookeeper is deployed as an ensemble of machines, there are a few pieces of the configuration that
weren't worth trying to automate. Specifically, each instance in the ensemble must have a distinct 
ZooKeeper copy number, and must also have the IP address/port info for all the nodes in the ensemble. 

To finish configuring things after the CF template runs, you need to do this (assuming you are using the 
default CF template values and deployed 3 instances)

Each machine's /mnt/data/zookeeper/zookeeper.X.X.X/conf/zoo.cfg needs to update the 3 node's connection 
details at the end of the file. Each of the 3 server lines must replace the placeholder text with the 
private IP address for the server.  Leave the port info after the first ':' alone.

Each machine must have its  /mnt/data/zookeeper/zookeeper.X.X.X/data/myid file that was created by the
CF template updated with the corresponding copy number. In the previous step, you set IP addresses for
server1, server2, and server3 in the zoo.cfg file. on the server1 box, you need to put a '1' in the myid
file. In the server2 box, you need to set the value to 2, and so on.

Finally, you can start up ZooKeeper on each box.

Change directory to:  /mnt/data/zookeeper/zookeeper.X.X.X  and run this command

   nohup ./bin/zkServer.sh start zoo.cfg &
   
 this will start the server as a deamon that will ignore disconnects from your terminal. You can monitor
 the Zookeeper by tailing the zookeeper.out file in the current directory on each box.
