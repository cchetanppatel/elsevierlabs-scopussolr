This is a sample Client App to read a Kinesis stream.

You must use a minimum Java 1.7.

lib -> Libraries used.
resources -> config file for the Kinesis App
src -> code (including the Kinesis Client Library)

This should not be considered 'production' code.  This was merely
used to prove that we could read records from a Kinesis shard(s)
and get them into a RedShift table.
